## What is Software Development?
##### Software development is the process of creating and maintaining source code. In this regard it has many different procedures. These are; programming, designing, testing, bug fixing, specifying, conceiving and documenting to create or maintain applications, frameworks or other software products. 

## What is a vulnerability?
##### A vulnerability in computing is a treat or weakness that can be exploited or manipulated by attackers to gain unauthorised access into a system. Vulnerabilities fall on three areas; The system flaw, the attackers access to the flaw and the capability to access the flaw and manipulate it. 


## Case study 1. Equifax
#### In July 2017 Equifax was breached by an unidentified attacker gaining access to user’s social security numbers, dates of birth and addresses. Overall 149 Million users in the US were at risk with 200,000 users credit card details being at risk and 649,000 users in the UK and 15,000 users’ financial information at risk. It took until the 7th of September 2017 for users to be notified about the breach. The data that was taken from users has huge implications as it can be used to create fake identities and setup fake bank accounts and credit cards in user’s names and even take out loans. In an attempt to reassure customers Equifax setup and website that lets users check if their information was breached. however, someone setup a fake replica website as a phishing scam to steal more user’s data. The site was erroneously promoted by Equifax themselves.

## Case study 2. Tesco Bank 
#### In November 2016 Tesco froze operations for a weekend after 20,00 users had money stolen from their account. Overall an estimated 40,00 users had been affected. The attackers found a vulnerability in the mobile banking app that they used to gain access to Tesco’s financial data. It had been revised later that only 9,000 accounts had money stolen however Tesco promised to repay all accounts that had been access costing them around 2.5 million.
