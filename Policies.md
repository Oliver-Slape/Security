## The business (Reboot Games)
---
Reboot games is a games production company that is in the business of rebooting older game titles into modern remakes. For this job to be done and completed the staff require a lot of advanced hardware and software that is very expensive and fragile. There is currently 15 members of staff in the business and they all use the same hardware and software.

The business has two owners and one manager. There is 12 other lower level staff that all have various roles the aid in work completion. The businesses clients are all vetted and negotiated on their solution they require for their problem. The business runs projects using the SCRUM methodology with weekly sprints. 


## Threats to an organisation
---
Within an organisation there will be many threats that it will face. These have to emitted for a company to run smoothly. A major threat to organisations is hackers especially in the new ventures technology is advancing into. Therefore, organisations must know how these hackers are a threat and how to prevent them.

### Worms:
---
A worm is a type of malware that will spread through a network by gaining entry from one system. It clones itself on the system then sends it to other systems on the same LAN or intranet that it is on or has access to. Itâ€™s used to attack security defenses in a system such as the fire wall or it can slow bandwidth and reduce security response times. 

### Viruses:
---
Viruses usually come in the form of a simple file. However, they are much more dangerous then they seem. The have the ability to corrupt all of the data on a system. They copy themselves to every area of the system it can access and infect the files found. They can be detected with anti-virus software or by limiting the access to files in the system. 

### Rootkit:
---
Rootkits are a completely different type of malware compared to what we've covered so far. They are very skilled at hiding themselves from anti malware software. It looks at the process taken to scan and search for malware and conceals itself when this happens. Because of the detecting and removing them can be very difficult. 

### Trojan Horse:
---
Trojan Horses are a form of social engineering. It gets the user to run a piece of software or download a file generally from an email or some sort of message. The package the user is baited into downloading or running generally has some form of malware hidden in it. This is one of the most common ways viruses or worms spread or get on systems. 

### Power cut:
---
Power cuts are completely random and unpredictable making them a hard risk to mediate. They can cause a massive loss of data as everything unsaved or backed up can be lost along with all functions being stopped. Also it could happen during backups which can cause corruption. This is why regular saves and back-ups are so important. 

### Data Theft:
---
Data can be one of the most important parts of a business. It could be confidential data or sensitive data about customers. It is vital it stays internal in the business. However, data theft is when someone uses methods to steal this data and move it external. This can be very profitable as data is a very valuable asset that other competitors or people will pay for. 

### Phishing:
---
Phishing is what leads people to being effected by Trojan Horses. It is where fake emails or messages are sent to a multitude of people or users with a Trojan Horse included or some form of other malicious program.

### Internal Leaks:
---
This is where confidential information or sensitive data leaves the company and is made public usually. This can be intentional or unintentional. However, there can be a lot to gain when it is done intentionally leading to big risks when handling information. This is why a lot of staff are made to sign a Non-Disclosure agreement when starting a job in a place that handles confidential or sensitive data. This is a security step that can prevent the leak as they are legally not allowed to and can end even end up in prison if found guilty. 

### Social Engineering:
---
This is where attackers will use the risk group of clients/users to access a system. They will use attacks such as phishing emails we mentioned earlier or USB baiting by leaving them around an office for users to plug into their systems. A way of preventing this is to educate the users and clients on these risks and allow them to prevent them through checking emails for phishing or to not plug in any external drives or USB's. 

## Security Procedures in Reboot Games
---
This section will show the different security procedures used in Reboot Games. Different security procedures are in place so that companies can stay secure and maintain a safe environment. One of these is using electronic door locks that can only be accessed using Identification Cards. This is also a concurrent activity in most companies as it allows building security and prevent unauthorised access to specific areas. Here are some more procedures we utilise.

### Identification Pass:
---
Reboot games is located within a college that uses electronic gates to access the main building. To enter the college you must be registered in the system. If you have misplaced your card this also allows them to identify you and allow you access through the reception. There is no way round the gate unless you have a card from one of the students or somehow copied one. Here is the procedure:

1. Enter the college
2. Approach the gate.
3. Hold the ID card to the scanner.
4. Wait for gates to open.
6. Walk through the gate.
7. Gate closes behind once walked through using sensors.

5. Authenticate with reception your in the system.
6. Receive a guest card or day stamp.
7. Enter through reception access.

### Door Lock

The ID cards also have other uses in the college. They can be used for electronic locks on the doors in the college. Different ID cards have different levels of access. For example staff ID cards have access to the staff rooms however, students wont have access to these areas. Some students have access to rooms other don't. For example Higher education students have their own rooms that can be accessed using one of their ID cards. The Procedure is:

1. Enter college.

3. Locate door you want to access.
4. Check you have authorisation to access designated room.

4. Find member of staff with required ID.
5. Wait for staff member to authenticate your identity.
6. wait for staff member to open door once authenticated.

### Regular Searches:
---
This procedure happens a few times a year and is run and managed by the police. The main gate is proceeded by a bag search and metal detectors that are both applicable to staff and students. The procedure is:

1. Enter the college.
2. Wait in que if present.
3. Move forward in que till reach a member of the security.
4. Follow instructions form security.

These procedures cover different vulnerabilities to security that can be prevented using policies.
