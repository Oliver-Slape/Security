## Threats to an organisation
---
Within an organisation there will be many threats that it will face. These have to emitted for a company to run smoothly. A major threat to organisations is hackers especially in the new ventures technology is advancing into. Therefore, organisations must know how these hackers are a threat and how to prevent them.

### Worms:
---
A worm is a type of malware that will spread through a network by gaining entry from one system. It clones itself on the system then sends it to other systems on the same LAN or intranet that it is on or has access to. Itâ€™s used to attack security defences in a system such as the firewall or it can slow bandwidth and reduce security response times. 

### Viruses:
---
Viruses usually come in the form of a simple file. However, they are much more dangerous then they seem. The have the ability to corrupt all of the data on a system. They copy themselves to every area of the system it can access and infect the files found. They can be detected with anti-virus software or by limiting the access to files in the system. 

### Rootkit:
---
Rootkits are a completely different type of malware compared to what we've covered so far. They are very skilled at hiding themselves from anti malware software. It looks at the process taken to scan and search for malware and conceals itself when this happens. Because of the detecting and removing them can be very difficult. 

### Trojan Horse:
---
Trojan Horses are a form of social engineering. It gets the user to run a piece of software or download a file generally from an email or some sort of message. The package the user is baited into downloading or running generally has some form of malware hidden in it. This is one of the most common ways viruses or worms spread or get on systems. 

### Power cut:
---
Power cuts are completely random and unpredictable making them a hard risk to mediate. They can cause a massive loss of data as everything unsaved or backed up can be lost along with all functions being stopped. Also it could happen during backups which can cause corruption. This is why regular saves and back-ups are so important. 

### Data Theft:
---
Data can be one of the most important parts of a business. It could be confidential data or sensitive data about customers. It is vital it stays internal in the business. However, data theft is when someone uses methods to steal this data and move it external. This can be very profitable as data is a very valuable asset that other competitors or people will pay for. 

### Phishing:
---
Phishing is what leads people to being effected by Trojan Horses. It is where fake emails or messages are sent to a multitude of people or users with a Trojan Horse included or some form of other malicious program.

### Internal Leaks:
---
This is where confidential information or sensitive data leaves the company and is made public usually. This can be intentional or unintentional. However, there can be a lot to gain when it is done intentionally leading to big risks when handling information. This is why a lot of staff are made to sign a Non-Disclosure agreement when starting a job in a place that handles confidential or sensitive data. This is a security step that can prevent the leak as they are legally not allowed to and can end even end up in prison if found guilty.
